# Money - Tracker
In this project I have developed a user-friendly interface allowing users to log and categorize their expenses, helping with budget management.

# Technologies Used:
* Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for server-side development
* React.js: A Javascript framework for frontend
* Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js
* MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing tasks and lists
* Nodemon: A development tool for automatically restarting the server on file changes

## Getting Started

* Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
* Install the dependencies using the command:
### `npm install`
### `npm i nodemon -g`

## Create your own Mongo_URL using Mongodb 
* Go to the api folder using cd api
* make .env file
* Write MONGO_URL = "your_url_created_using_Mongodb"
* Start the server using nodemon index.js

## Create your own REACT_APP_API_URL
* make .env file in the root folder
* Write REACT_APP_API_URL = ""http://localhost:4000/api"

## In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.



Once you will get the message "connection successful" in the terminal, Feel free to explore and customize the application to suit your needs!
